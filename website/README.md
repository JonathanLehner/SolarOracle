# SolarOracle web UI
Based on Moralis `ethereum-boilerplate`, with a Moralis server on Kovan testnet (required for Chainlink Keepers)

## Goal
in the website you can login with Metamask and pay Ether to a smart contract to pay for electricity generated by solar panels, which will be tradable as NFTs for investors. We use Chainlink to integrate the smart meter data via an API, and we use Chainlink Keeper to automatically pay from the escrow every month according to the oracle data. 

## smart contracts
